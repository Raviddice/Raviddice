          "Filled with pious, mechanical rage and ecstasy, David Leo Rice has created a catastrophe, a religion of some sort. Fishy as it may seem, Jakob (his zealous protagonist) blows our minds and charges our electric socket with his hysterical, esoteric coming of age. Severely disciplined by martinet parents, Jakob becomes a Trader Joe’s frenzied witness of some sort. Rice has created a world like none other. An ophidian world dressed and fashioned for more devastation than revelation, more mother than meadow, more irresistible than blasphemous.  – Vi Khi Nao",

        "The childhood of Jakob, The New House's young hero, is one unlike that of your typical coming-of-age narrative. His is a youth surrounded by prophetic dreams, religious schisms, and secretive conversations — plus some shocking scenes of violence. Rice's prose creates a mood abounding with mystery and dread, and The New House would fit comfortably beside the likes of Michael McDowell's Toplin and Iain Banks's The Wasp Factory in terms of disquieting portraits of sustained alienation. – Tobias Carroll, author of Reel and Political Sign",

        "David Leo Rice achieves a superb naturalism in recounting the experiences of young Jacob, contraposed to the world of the book, where natural laws do not interfere. There is a profound freedom in the depiction of how material objects with extension interact with material objects with extension—that space can be filled twice. A non-metaphorical depiction of contradiction (that inside things there might be other things) undergirds a portrayal of the artist informed by an ambient mysticism but not of it. Rice’s stunning manipulation of identity over time allows the book to relate a coming-of-age story and an anticipatory retrospective of the life of the artist at once. The New House leaves the reader to reflect on whether there is anything holding an identity together, or whether whatever we are was burned in the woods long ago. – Charlene Elsby",

        "The horror in Drifter’s meticulous and exquisitely bleak stories does not impose itself from without, but is instead woven into the very inscrutable necessity to exist, so that even with the more abstract or extramundane tales there’s this same intimidating sense of compulsive human duty – out of nowhere and for nothing. The details, however familiar, are always in devious service to some shadowing alterity, some arcane yet immersive otherness, enacting a kind of doubling, a superpositioning of identity, that through its overdetermination makes David Leo Rice’s creations seem both eerily dense and unreal. Gloriously inventive, sober and freakish, this is a collection to relish. — Gary J. Shipley, author of DREAMS OF AMPUTATION and STRATAGEM OF THE CORPSE",
